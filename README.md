plunger
=======

Simple messaging client for the shell - provides basic access to messaging-providers, such as [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com), [JBoss HornetQ](http://www.jboss.org/hornetq), [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org) and [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org).

With plunger you can:
- list all available queues and topics (including the amount of messages and consumers)
- consume/browse messages
- put messages in a queue or topic
- get the amount of messages or consumers for a specific destination


See the [full documentation in the wiki](https://github.com/galan/plunger/wiki).
